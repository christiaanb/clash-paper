  abstract = {Modern microprocessors require an immense investment of time and effort
	to create and verify, from the high level architectural design downwards.
	We are exploring ways to increase the productivity of design engineers
	by creating a domain specific language for specifying and simulating
	processor architectures. We believe that the structuring principles
	used in modern functional programming languages, such as static typing,
	parametric polymorphism, first class functions, and lazy evaluation
	provide a good formalism for such a domain specific language, and
	have made initial progress by creating a library on top of the functional
	language Haskell. We have specified the integer subset of an out
	of order, superscalar DLX microprocessor, with register renaming,
	a reorder buffer, a global reservation station, multiple execution
	units, and speculative branch execution. Two key abstractions of
	this library are the signal abstract data type (ADT), which models
	the simulation history of a wire, and the transaction ADT, which
	models the state of an entire instruction as it travels through the
	microprocessor},

  abstract = {Reduction circuits are used to reduce rows of ?oating point values
	to single values. Binary ?oating point operators often have deep
	pipelines, which may cause hazards when many consecutive rows have
	to be reduced. We present an algorithm by which any number of consecutive
	rows of arbitrary lengths can be reduced by a pipelined commutative
	and associative binary operator in an efficient manner. The algorithm
	is simple to implement, has a low latency, produces results in-order,
	and requires only small buffers. Besides, it uses only a single pipeline
	for the involved operation. The complexity of the algorithm depends
	on the depth of the pipeline, not on the length of the input rows.
	In this paper we discuss an implementation of this algorithm and
	we prove its correctness.},

  abstract = {Modern microprocessors require an immense investment of time and effort
	to create and verify, from the high level architectural design downwards.
	We are exploring ways to increase the productivity of design engineers
	by creating a domain specific language for specifying and simulating
	processor architectures. We believe that the structuring principles
	used in modern functional programming languages, such as static typing,
	parametric polymorphism, first class functions, and lazy evaluation
	provide a good formalism for such a domain specific language, and
	have made initial progress by creating a library on top of the functional
	language Haskell. We have specified the integer subset of an out
	of order, superscalar DLX microprocessor, with register renaming,
	a reorder buffer, a global reservation station, multiple execution
	units, and speculative branch execution. Two key abstractions of
	this library are the signal abstract data type (ADT), which models
	the simulation history of a wire, and the transaction ADT, which
	models the state of an entire instruction as it travels through the
	microprocessor},
